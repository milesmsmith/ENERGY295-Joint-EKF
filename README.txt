# ENERGY295-Joint-EKF
There are a lot of files in this repository, but a lot of them are obsolete.
The important files with the most up to date code that we used in our final results can be found in the following files:

Finding_Q_and_R_using_GA.m
Running_HW4_on_Project_Data.m
project_code_28Nov2021.m <-- this is the most important one (its interactive and will run the AEKF and EKF on any test result)
project_plotting_script.m
project_table_making_script.m
